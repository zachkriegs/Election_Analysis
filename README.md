## Election Audit Summary
The success of this script in this congressional precinct election is just the beginning of what it can be used for in other elections across the country. This election analysis script can be used as a model for future elections such as senatorial districts and more. The script could easily be modified to not only include county results, but statewide results as well such as for State Senator. A simple addition to the csv file including the state and adding code to account for this would make this possible. This script could also be modified to find results for voter turnout by party. Political parties would be very interested in knowing the turnout per county of their voters, so they know better which counties to target in future elections.
